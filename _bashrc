# Nothing to see here â€” Everything's in .bash_profile

# About this file:
# When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, 
# bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file 
# exists. This may be inhibited by using the --norc option. 
# The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute 
# commands from file instead of ~/.bashrc.
